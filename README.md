# Experiment-3

# Problem 1

The program to this problem begins by importing Pandas and loading the dataset cars.csv into a DataFrame named cars. This step is essential, as it converts the external CSV file into a structured format that can be easily manipulated and analyzed. By displaying the DataFrame immediately after loading, the code allows verification that the dataset has been successfully imported and is ready for use.

The program then used the head() function, which shows the first five rows of the DataFrame. This preview helps confirm the structure of the data and reveals the initial entries of the table. Following this, the tail() function was used to display the last five rows, which provides insight into the ending portion of the given dataset. Together, these two functions give a quick overview of the dataset from both ends and ensure its completeness.

The last line of the program converts the program into a Python script or .py file by using the to_csv().
